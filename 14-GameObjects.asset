      Text:
        m_Untranslated: "So far, all we\u2019ve done is create a Project with an
          empty <b>Scene</b> and some <b>Assets</b>. We haven\u2019t made anything
          yet. \r\nIn order to start making something that we can run as a game we
          must start placing Assets in the Scene.\r\n<b>Assets</b> are the building
          blocks of any game we make in Unity, but to make something functional,
          we need to create <b>Game Objects</b>. Unity Scenes are built from a collection
          of Game Objects with generally one Game Object representing one object/thing
          in the level. \r\nFor example, for a simple Pong game, we\u2019d have at
          least a Game Object for: the ball, the left player\u2019s paddle, and the
          right player\u2019s paddle. We might also need Game Objects for visible
          things such as the top and bottom walls and maybe even the players\u2019
          scores (see the upcoming lecture on Game Objects). Additionally, depending
          on how things were implemented, we might even have \u201Cinvisible\u201D
          Game Objects for detecting when the ball had gone off the screen and whether
          it had gone off the left or right.\r\nLater in semester we will learn more
          about thinking about what Game Objects we need, when we talk about \"Game
          Modelling\"."
